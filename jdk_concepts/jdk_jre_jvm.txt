Intially, Java is invented by James Gosling at Micro Systems.
But they are 3 persons intailly java is developed my the OAK but later it converted into java.
Later, Micro systems is adapted by oracle in early 1990.
Java language having various features like platform independent,high sequrity,scalability ,various collections for tools and code efficient.

In Java Development Kit have combination of JVM,Jar files,just in time complier and development tools.
Now,Let us start with compling process in java first, the java is converts the program into byte code using java complier and then byte code is converted to machine code using various platform jvms. The magic of byte code is platform independent and it converted into .class file. 
The fun fact is the jvm is platform dependent but the byte code is platform independent.
Just In Time complier is the complier which is helps the jvm during the same sequence of pattern code is repeated its time taking process to process the same patterned code repeated by the jvm. 
So,jvm takes the pattern and it process the pattern repeatedly.
Finally, JIT complier increases the code execution and decrease the time of execution of a program. 
In JDK, we having the jar files it having the jar component having the full pack of  classes which was created and put them together in a .jar files.

JVM is converts the byte code into machine code which makes the java code as the independent through out the any platform.
But JVM is platform dependent in nature it only helps the code to convertion. The  credit all goes to the byte code which is platform independent.
